{"guide":"This is a markdown guide for writing blog posts in markdown!\n\nUser input markdown is parsed using [markdown-it](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it/tree/master). Syntax highlighting for code is also available for each language.\n\n## Quick start with markdown\n\n### 1. Titles\n\nIn markdown we can use the # symbol to create titles. You can vary the size of the title by simply adding more # symbols. The syntax for making a title is: \n\n`# title goes here`.\n\n# Title 1\n\n## Title 2\n\n### Title 3\n\n#### Title 4\n\n##### Title 5\n\n###### Title 6\n\n### 2. Separators\n\nYou can make a line separator between sections or paragraphs of your text. For example, the bellow light shaded line is a separator that separates this section from the next.\n\n---\n\nAnd this is the next section. The way you make a separator is by going to a new line then typing three dashes `---`.\n\n### 3. Images\n\nYou can include images in your blogs (or in any markdown file/markdown format input)! The way you do that is by typing:\n\n\\`![describe image for screen readers to help people with disability](url of image goes here)\\`\n\nExample:\n\n![screenshot from bocchi the rock! anime](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarisaCodes/misc/main/public/images/bocchi.png)\n\nThe syntax: \\`\\!\\[screenshot from bocchi the rock! anime\\]\\(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarisaCodes/misc/main/public/images/bocchi.png\\)\\`\n\n### 4. Links\n\nLinks are just like images except you exclude the excalmation mark. So, the syntaxt is \\`[Text you want to appear](actual link address goes here)\\`.\n\nFor example: [Click me!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvFZjo5PgG0)\n\n### 5. Lists\n\nThere are two types of lists: unordered and ordered lists.\nUnordered lists can be made by going to a new line for each item and typing a dash `-` at the beginning of the line.\nExample:\n\n- item\n- another\n- yet another\n\nThe markdown syntax looks like:\n\n```md\n- item\n- another\n- yet another\n```\n\nOrdered lists are very simple, just use `x.` where `x` is a number.\n\nFor example:\n\n1. item 1\n2. item 2\n3. item 3\n\nThe markdown syntax looks like:\n\n```md\n1. item 1\n2. item 2\n3. item 3\n```\n\n### 6. Code\n\nFinally, we are going to learn how to write code in case you want to put some code snippets in your blog!\n\nYou can type backticks: \\`code here\\`\n\nUse them just like quotation marks \"to wrap around your code!\"\n\nFor a single line, one backtick on either side is enough.\n\nFor example:\n\n`console.log(\"hello world\")`\n\nThe syntax is:\n\n\\`console.log(\"hello world\")\\`\n\nTo make entire code blocks with highlight support for a specific language see the following example:\n\nExample output of a hello world program in `C`:\n\n```C\n# include <stdio.h>\n\nint main(void)\n{\n  char* greeting = \"hello world!\";\n  printf(\"%s\", greeting);\n}\n```\n\nThe syntax for making this is:\n\n\\`\\`\\`C\n\n\\# include <stdio.h>\n\nint main(void)\n\n{\n\n  char* greeting = \"hello world!\";\n\n  printf(\"%s\", greeting);\n\n}\n\n\\`\\`\\`\n\nIf you have already noticed, instead of one backtick, you use three to wrap the block of code. After the **first three** backticks you specify the language by typing the file extension for that language right next to the last of the first three backticks, without any space between. Here, the language is `C`, see if you can spot that letter in the syntax!\n",
"title": "# Hello world!"
